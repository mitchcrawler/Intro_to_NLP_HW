      "that these were likely secondary to her congestive heart\n",
      "failure. They felt that there was no evidence of amiodarone\n",
      "toxicity contributing to her pulmonary status. By the time of\n",
      "her discharge, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 11806**] was satting 94% on room air. She\n",
      "was otherwise not dyspneic. She did have some decreased\n",
      "breath sounds at the bases with the presence of mild\n",
      "bilateral pleural effusions which had been stable on serial\n",

      "\n",
      "1. CARDIOVASCULAR: On postoperative day 0, the patient\n",
      "   experienced brief runs of nonsustained ventricular\n",
      "   tachycardia, at which time amiodarone was started, but\n",
      "   after the immediate postoperative period, these episodes\n",
      "   resolved. She had been in atrial fibrillation in the past\n",
      "   but, in fact, remained in sinus rhythm throughout the\n",
      "   course of her hospitalization. Her congestive heart\n",
      "   failure was managed with aggressive diuresis and afterload\n",
      "   reduction with ACE inhibitors. There was a question as to\n",
      "   whether her pleural effusions were secondary to congestive\n",
      "   heart failure from a problem with her aortic valve, for\n",
      "   which she underwent repeat echocardiography. Her repeat\n",
      "   echocardiogram showed that her ejection fraction was\n",
      "   normal at greater than 65%. Her aortic valve had a\n",
      "   prosthetic which was seated in good position, but had\n",
      "   somewhat of an increased gradient present. There was 1+\n",
      "   mitral regurgitation. Her aortic valve mean gradient was\n",
      "   36 mm. It was not felt that the valve was responsible for\n",
      "   her recurrent pleural effusions. Her CHF, as noted, was\n",
      "   managed with a combination of beta blockers and ACE\n",
      "   inhibitors. We added calcium channel blockers for some\n",
      "   time after consultation with congestive heart failure\n",
      "   service, but prior to her discharge it was felt that the\n",
      "   combination of beta blockade and ACE inhibitor alone would\n",
      "   be adequate for her control, along with diuretics. She\n",
      "   never had any evidence of postoperative cardiac ischemia,\n",
      "   and her bypass graft seemed to be functioning well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to her discharge, as noted, she was in sinus rhythm on\n",
      "a stable dose of beta blocker and ACE inhibitor with\n",
      "amiodarone. Her Coumadin was not restarted, as she had\n",
      "remained in sinus rhythm, and otherwise not reverted to\n",
      "atrial fibrillation, and also due to the fact that there was\n",
      "concern that there might be some risk of instability while\n",
      "walking, or falls while on anticoagulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. GASTROINTESTINAL: No major issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: The patient was, as\n",
      "   noted, significantly volume overloaded in the initial\n",
      "   postoperative period. First, she was diuresed\n",
      "   aggressively. She remained mildly volume overloaded\n",
      "   throughout the course of her hospitalization, for which\n",
      "   she was diuresed on and off, depending upon her renal\n",
      "   function. By the time of her discharge, we had her weight\n",
      "   down to 59.6 kg. Her preoperative weight was 58.2 kg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding her nutrition, the patient's albumin was 2.5, which\n",
      "may have contributed to some of her edema. She was given\n",
      "nutritional supplementation with each meal to assist her in\n",
      "returning to appropriate nutritional status.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. RENAL: The patient's baseline creatinine was between 1.3\n",
      "   to 1.6, which it remained throughout most of her\n",
      "   hospitalization. During periods of aggressive diuresis,\n",
      "   her creatinine did bump to a maximum of 2.3, at which time\n",
      "   her diuretics were held, or decreased. Prior to her\n",
      "   discharge, her BUN and creatinine were 35 and 1.4. She\n",
      "   never became anuric and, as noted, her creatinine had\n",
      "   normalized prior to discharge, and she was making adequate\n",
      "   volumes of urine. Various combinations of diuretics which\n",
      "   were used included acetazolamide, furosemide and Bumex.\n",
      "   The patient responded best to Bumex which she had been\n",
      "   taking at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. HEMATOLOGIC: The patient did require multiple blood\n",
      "   transfusions for her blood loss anemia in the immediate\n",
      "   postoperative period. She responded appropriately to each\n",
      "   transfusion and had no further issues of bleeding. As\n",
      "   noted, her Coumadin was not restarted, given the fact that\n",
      "   she had been in sinus rhythm, and also while ambulating at\n",
      "   one point she had a fall where she did hit her head. She\n",
      "   had no neurologic deficit, and otherwise no lacerations,\n",
      "   or subsequent consequence of the fall, but given the fact\n",
      "   that she may be at risk for this again, it was felt that\n",
      "   the risks of anticoagulation outweighed the benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: During her hospitalization, the\n",
      "   patient had a urinary tract infection  for which she was\n",
      "   treated with Bactrim and levofloxacin. She otherwise had\n",
      "   no other infectious complications.\n",

      "a dementia work-up consisting of Vitamin B12, folate and\n",
      "syphilis which were all normal or negative; and for infection\n",
      "as well.  He had no signs of infection and his chest x-ray\n",
      "showed fluid in his lungs which then decreased on repeat\n",
      "chest x-ray taken after dialysis.  He was never febrile and\n",
      "never had an elevated white count.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardiac enzymes were also sent showing the troponin T of\n",
      "0.24, however, in the absence of chest pain or EKG changes,\n",

      "felt that these mildly elevated troponin T values may be\n",
      "falsely influenced by renal insufficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding his renal failure, by Nursing reports, the patient\n",
      "often improved in mental status after dialysis, although he\n",
      "had no signs of uremia.  During this admission, his mental\n",
      "status seems stable regardless of hemodialysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "A head CT scan was negative, showing no acute trauma or\n",
      "cerebrovascular accident which could explain his altered\n",

      "findings on examination suggested that he had no acute\n",
      "intracranial process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because he had a mildly elevated bicarbonate on routine\n",

      "low yield.  One other possibility that could have contributed\n",
      "to his mental status initially was his high blood pressure,\n",
      "however, on better control of his pressures during admission,\n",
      "he had no change in his mental status.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although a diabetic, his sugars were fairly well controlled\n",

      "2.  HYPERTENSION:  The patient initially presented very\n",
      "hypertensive.  He had systolic blood pressures to the low\n",

      "Hydralazine which decreased his blood pressure.  On the\n",

      "returned into normal sinus rhythm with a rate in the 80s by\n",

      "2) HYPOXEMIA:  The patient continued to improve during his\n",
      "hospital course, and on the day of discharge was satting well\n",
      "on room air.  The most likely etiology of his hypoxemia was\n",

      "brittle during his hospital stay and rather difficult to\n",
      "control especially with his varying intake with the\n",
      "reintroduction of tube feeds as supplements for his\n",

      "7) NUTRITION:  The patient came in with chronic malnutrition\n",
      "and decreased muscle mass.  While in the hospital, he was\n",
      "begun on tube feeds due to concerns that the patient was\n",
      "aspirating while he was in the MICU.  Subsequent evaluation\n",
      "by speech and swallow therapists revealed that he had no\n",
      "signs or symptoms of aspiration, and he was encouraged to\n",
      "return to eating PO.  However, he reports decreased appetite\n",
      "and; therefore, it was decided to restart supplemental tube\n",
      "feeds to increase his nutritional state.  This will need to\n",
