Rhythm: pt had 2 episodes of monomorphic VT accompanied by \\\\nfall in BP, LOC, terminated x 1 via precordial thumb.  \\\\nElectrolytes were repeleted, pt was bolused with Amiodarone x 2, \\\\nand started on an Amio gtt. Amiodarone was then changed to po, \\\\nwith a dosing schedule of 400 mg BID for one week, followed by \\\\n400 mg daily for one week, then 200 mg per day.  Monomorphic VT \\\\nthought to be likely due to a fixed area of scarring from \\\\nprevious MI.  Placement of an ICD was discussed.  However, given \\\\nthe pt\\\\\\'s poor prognosis for non sudden cardiac death reasons, \\\\nand given his increased infectious risk, it was decided to treat \\\\nhis arrhythmia medically.  Of note, the QT interval was \\\\nprolonged (506), likely secondary to amiodarone.  Patient \\\\nremained in sinus rhythm on Amiodarone.     \\\\n2. CAD: Pt with NSTEMI. Cath on [**10-30**] showed 3 vessel disease, \\\\nsubsequently underwent successful stenting of OM, D1, LAD and \\\\nIABP placement. IABP was discontinued after the patient was able \\\\nto maintain his own pressure.\\\\nEcho completed on [**10-31**], which showed apical akinesis, with \\\\nseverely depressed systolic function.  Patient was initially \\\\nstarted on heparin and bridged to Coumadin, however, he had \\\\nanother episode of guaiac positive stool, and given his history \\\\nof melena and coffee ground emesis, the risk for GI bleed was \\\\nthought to be high and anticoagulation was discontinued.\\\\nThe patient was continued on an aspirin, Statin, beta blocker, \\\\nand was started on an ACE, all of which he will continue as an \\\\noutpatient.  His swan and sheath were discontinued without \\\\ncomplications.\\\\n3.PUMP: CHF: EF 20% by ECHO\\\\nHe was initially placed on Imdur/Hydral for afterload reduction \\\\nand an ACE was initially avoided in an attempt to salvage his \\\\nkidneys.  However, he was eventually started on low-dose \\\\nlisinopril to be titrated up if necessary.  Patient also \\\\nunderwent hemodialysis on Mon/Wed/Fri schedule.\\\\n4. Renal: Chronic renal disease, secondary to hypertensive \\\\nnephrosclerosis, is status post graft placement with mature A-V \\\\ngraft. Quentin catheter initially used, then discontinued once \\\\ngraft accessible.  On [**11-9**], graft noted to be difficult to \\\\naccess per renal, patient underwent AV fistulogram, and \\\\nsuccessful angioplasty was performed.  \\\\n5. ID: Patient completed a seven day course of levofloxacin for \\\\nsuspected pneumonia, white blood count noted to be persistently \\\\nelevated.  Patient was pan cultured, and a urine culture was \\\\npositive for yeast.  Foley catheter was discontinued and a \\\\nrepeat culture was sent, also positive for [**Female First Name (un) **].  Patient \\\\nstarted on a 2 week course of Fluconazole.  Blood cultures \\\\npending at time of discharge, no growth to date.\\\\n6. Heme: anemia, likely anemia of chronic disease from chronic \\\\nrenal disease.  Patient also had an episode of melena and coffee \\\\nground emesis, guaiac positive stool.  Hematocrit was followed, \\\\nand patient was transfused as necessary to keep hematocrit above \\\\n30.  Patient will need GI workup as an outpatient. Oral iron \\\\nsupplementation was discontinued as patient receiving Fe in \\\\naddition to EPO and Procrit at hemodialysis\\\\n7. DM: Patient was started on glargine for persistent \\\\nhyperglycemia and covered with a regular insulin sliding scale \\\\nwith Accu-Check to monitor. \\\\n8.

No tobacco use and rare\\\\nETOH use.\\\\n\\\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of presentation, she was\\\\nafebrile with a heart rate of 63, blood pressure 120/50 to\\\\n160/60, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 99% on two\\\\nliters.  She is in no acute distress lying in bed.\\\\nExtraocular movements are intact.  The pupils are equal,\\\\nround, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Anicteric.\\\\nNo bruit or jugular venous distention appreciated.  Heart is\\\\nregular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or\\\\ngallops.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally\\\\nposteriorly.  Abdomen with normoactive bowel sounds, soft,\\\\nnontender, nondistended.  Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing\\\\nor edema.  Right leg immobilizer placed.  Her dorsalis pedis\\\\nwere [**3-14**].  Her neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves\\\\nwith the exception of her facial nerve were intact.  She has\\\\nflat nasolabial fold on the left side.  Normal upper and\\\\nlower extremity strength.\\\\n\\\\nLABORATORY DATA:  On the day of admission, white blood cell\\\\ncount 6.6, hematocrit 32.6, platelet count 291,000.  Total\\\\ncholesterol was 173, HDL 45, LDL 109.\\\\n\\\\nASSESSMENT:  This is an 81 year old female with a history of\\\\ncoronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, carotid\\\\nartery stenosis, bilaterally, hypertension,\\\\nhypercholesterolemia, admitted to the CCU status post right\\\\ninternal carotid artery stent.\\\\n\\\\n1.  Neurology - The patient had stent, status post right\\\\ninternal carotid artery stent.  She initially was on\\\\nNeo-Synephrine to maintain a blood pressure goal between 110\\\\nand 150.  She had q1hour neurological checks and then q2hour\\\\nneurological checks.  Initially, her Neo-Synephrine was\\\\nweaned off and the patient\\'s blood pressure gradually rose to\\\\napproximately 160 to 170.  As a result, some very low dose\\\\nNitroglycerin drip was started to try to keep her blood\\\\npressure between 150 and 110.  The patient had hypotension\\\\nwith blood pressure down to 70.  The Nitroglycerin drip was\\\\nstopped and Neo-Synephrine drip was started with blood\\\\npressure up to as high as 200s. When all drips were stopped,\\\\nher blood pressure gradually came down to 120 to 130\\\\nsystolic.  This was fairly soon after the stent had been\\\\nplaced and the patient arriving in the CCU.  Overnight the\\\\nfirst hospital night, the patient was placed on a low dose of\\\\nNeo-Synephrine 0.1 to maintain her blood pressure between 110\\\\nto 120 with gradually being able to be weaned off the drip\\\\nand on the second hospital day, the Neo-Synephrine drip was\\\\nturned off.  The patient did not require any Atropine in the\\\\nCCU, however, she did have a symptomatic bradycardia going\\\\ndown to mid 30s while she is sleeping, coming up to mid 40s\\\\nto 50s when being awakened.  On the neurologic examination,\\\\nthere was no focality or any change in her examination from\\\\nher baseline which had the left nasolabial fold flattening.\\\\nHowever, the patient did seem to be confused the evening\\\\nstatus post the procedure and on day two on the [**2883-5-27**], the\\\\npatient had a CT of the head without contrast which showed no\\\\ndefinite hemorrhage. The results were reviewed with the\\\\nneurologist following along with the team, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  On the\\\\nsecond day postprocedure, the patient was acting more\\\\noriented and less confused.  Her confusion seemed to coincide\\\\nwith the onset of night fall and possible disturbance of her\\\\n[**Doctor Last Name 314**]/wake cycle.  The rest of her stay the patient had blood\\\\npressure near goal being consistently in the 120s to 130s.\\\\nShe was transferred to the floor and Step-Down Unit on [**Hospital Ward Name **]\\\\nTwo for further monitoring.  The patient was seen by physical\\\\ntherapy who felt the patient was a fall risk and recommended\\\\nfor both feet physical therapy and occupational therapy and a\\\\nshort term rehabilitation to optimize her functional capacity\\\\nbefore returning to living alone at home.\\\\n\\\\n2.  Hematology - The night after the procedure the patient\\\\nhad a right arterial and venous sheath in place for her\\\\narterial line that was monitoring her blood pressure.  The\\\\npatient, despite having a leg immobilizer and numerous\\\\ndiscussions and explanations and exhortations to stay in bed,\\\\nattempted to get out of bed on the first night of her\\\\nadmission, and was seen by house staff.  House staff and\\\\nnursing staff got the patient into bed.  Her groin\\\\nexamination was stable with no bruit or hematoma, however, on\\\\nthe next day, her hematocrit dropped to 26.3.  The patient\\\\nhad two units of packed red blood cells transfused with her\\\\nhematocrit being 34.9 on the day of discharge.  Her CT of her\\\\nabdomen and pelvis showed no retroperitoneal hematoma.  This\\\\nexamination was done on [**2883-5-28**].\\\\n\\\\n3.  Blood pressure control - The patient will be discharged\\\\non Univasc 7.5 mg twice a day and will follow-up with Dr.\\\\n[**First Name (STitle) **] in four to six weeks to have her blood pressure\\\\nmedications adjusted possibly placing her back on her beta\\\\nblocker as well.\\\\n\\\\n4.  Coronary artery disease - The patient was continued on\\\\nher Aspirin and now will be on Plavix for life long therapy.\\\\n\\\\n5.  Infectious disease - The patient had a low grade\\\\ntemperature maximizing at 100.5 on the day prior to\\\\ndischarge.  She had urine and blood cultures sent, all of\\\\nwhich are no growth at the time of discharge.  As well, her\\\\nurinalysis was unremarkable.  She had no localizing symptoms\\\\nof temperature or fever. Her temperature is 100 temperature\\\\nmaximum on the day of discharge.\\\\n\\\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.\\\\n\\\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\\\n1.

She was noted to have severe facial and \\\\nneck edema for which diuresis was initiated. Her permenant \\\\npacemaker was interoggated by the electrophysiology service and \\\\nreprogrammed. An underlying atrial fibrillation was noted. A \\\\nheparin induced thrombocytopenia was sent for thrombocytopenia \\\\nwhich was negative. On [**2554-7-7**], Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] was extubated however \\\\npromptly developed respiratory distress requiring reintubation. \\\\nThe neurology service was consulted for anisocoria. A head CT \\\\nscan was obtained which showed small areas of hypodensity within \\\\nthe left frontal lobe and right frontoparietal region, as well \\\\nas within the subcortical white matter and corona radiata \\\\nbilaterally. Her anisocoria subsequently resolved. Given her \\\\ndecreased level of consciouseness, the stroke service felt that \\\\nshe liklely experienced a cerebrovascular accident and coumadin \\\\nshould be started when it was safe. The thoracic surgery service \\\\nwas consulted for a tracheostomy. It was decided that she was \\\\nindeed a candidate for a tracheostomy however given her history \\\\nof radiation, an open procedure may be best. While changing a \\\\ncentral line, Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] became hypotensive which responded to \\\\nresuscitation. The electrophysiology service was asked to \\\\nevaluate her pacemaker which was found to be functioning within \\\\nnormal limits. Slight changes were made to her sensing. Rate \\\\ncontrol of her atrial fibrillation was recommended. The physical \\\\ntherapy worked with Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] daily. On [**2554-7-10**], the thoracic \\\\nsurgery service performed a tracheostomy without complication. A \\\\nbronchoscopy was later performed which did not reveal \\\\nsignificant secretions. The ventilator was slowly weaned to \\\\nCPAP. The speech and swallow service was consulted. As she had \\\\nnot tolerated a passe muir valve, a bedside swallowing \\\\nevaluation was defferred and a PEG feeding tube was recommended. \\\\nA PEG was placed on [**2554-7-16**] for long term nutrition needs. Mrs. \\\\n[**Known patient lastname **] continued to experience episodes of hypotension which \\\\nresponded to pressors. Most of her episodes seemed to be related \\\\nto atrial fibrillation which was aggressively controlled with \\\\namiodarone. As she was subtherapeutic on coumadin, heparin was \\\\nstarted as a bridge. Her neurologic status improved and she was \\\\nable to move all extremities to commmand. She began to tolerate \\\\nher tube feeds and continued to improve over the next several \\\\ndays, using her trach collar. CVL was discontinued on [**7-24**] and \\\\nINR was therapeutic [**Company 10761**] 98.0, 95/46, V paced at 81, RR 30 \\\\nSIMV, 5 peep, 10 pressure support, 40%, alert, awake and \\\\ncomfortable.

The patient was subsequently transferred to\\\\nthe MICU on [**3364-6-7**].  The patient had initially gone to the\\\\nO.R. for a skin flap with a full thickness skin graft to the\\\\nleft hand.  The patient received 15 mg intramuscular of\\\\nToradol preop.  Following the procedure the patient passed\\\\napproximately 250 cc\\\\\\'s of melanotic stool.  Crit at the time\\\\nwas 23.5 at 11 AM and 20.3 at 3 PM.  The patient remained\\\\nhemodynamically stable with heart rates in 70\\\\\\'s to 90\\\\\\'s and\\\\nblood pressure of 100 to 160/40 to 60.  Anesthesia placed a\\\\nleft IJ for central venous access and the patient received\\\\napproximately 700 cc\\\\\\'s of intravenous fluids\\\\nintraoperatively.  In the Post Anesthesia Care Unit the\\\\ngastrointestinal team was consulted and\\\\nesophagogastroduodenoscopy performed which was normal\\\\n(bilious material in the stomach, no signs of bleeding).\\\\nRecommended colonoscopy following transfusion.  The labs were\\\\ndrawn postoperatively showing platelets of 255, BUN 107 up\\\\nfrom 51 from [**3364-5-7**], an INR of 1.7 and a PTT of 55.1.  The\\\\npatient was subsequently given DDAVP.  At 7:15 PM the patient\\\\npassed approximately 200 cc\\\\\\'s of melena and was subsequently\\\\ntransferred to the medical Intensive Care Unit.\\\\n\\\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\\\n1.  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus times 50 years,\\\\ncomplicated by end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,\\\\ncomplicated by retinopathy, legally blind, complicated by\\\\nneuropathy.\\\\n2.

Scoliosis progressive.\\\\n12. Hip \"fusion\" with back pain requiring narcotics.\\\\n\\\\nThe patient has no known coronary artery disease.\\\\n\\\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\\\\n1.  Synthroid 150 mg p.o. q day.\\\\n2.  Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q day.\\\\n3.  Aspirin 81 mg q day.\\\\n4.  Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q day.\\\\n5.  Timolol eyedrops 0.5%\\\\n6.  Renagel\\\\n7.  Ultram.\\\\n8.  Colace.\\\\n9.  Lisinopril.\\\\n\\\\nALLERGIES: Codeine, question renal failure.\\\\n\\\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.7, heart rate 84, blood\\\\npressure 125/37, respiratory rate 14, sating 95% on three\\\\nliters.  General:  Awake but drowsy, answers questions\\\\nappropriately, well nourished in no apparent distress.  The\\\\npatient having periods of apnea greater than 20 seconds.\\\\nHead, eyes, ears, nose and throat anicteric sclera,\\\\noropharynx benign.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.\\\\nNo murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation\\\\nbilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended,\\\\npositive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No edema, nonfunctional\\\\narteriovenous fistula in the right upper extremity and left\\\\nupper extremity.\\\\n\\\\nLABORATORY:  On [**3364-6-6**] white count 14.8, hematocrit 20.3,\\\\npotassium 5.1, BUN 107, creatinine 7.3, CPK 34, Troponin\\\\n0.11.\\\\n\\\\nElectrocardiogram is normal sinus rhythm at 75 beats per\\\\nminute, normal axis and intervals, no acute ST changes, no\\\\nchanges when compared to previous Echocardiogram.\\\\n\\\\nChest x-ray for left IG placement.  Heart normal size.  No\\\\npneumothorax.  Right upper lobe opacity stable compared to\\\\nprevious chest x-ray.  Recommend follow-up CT scan.\\\\n\\\\nMicrobiology:  Wound cultures left hand from [**5-31**] no growth.\\\\n\\\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\\\\n1.  Gastrointestinal bleed:   During the hospital course\\\\nhematocrit declined 35 to 30 to 24 on day of transfer.  The\\\\npatient went for skin graft of the left hand.  After the\\\\nprocedure the patient passed 250 cc\\\\\\'s of melena as before\\\\nthough remained hemodynamically stable with a repeat crit of\\\\n20.  Underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which was\\\\nnegative with transfer to the TCU for monitoring.  The\\\\npatient was typed and crossed, matched for four units with a\\\\ngoal crit of 30.  Protonix was started 40 mg intravenous q\\\\nday for gastrointestinal prophylaxis and aspirin and\\\\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were held off.  The\\\\nrecommendation was to move further with a colonoscopy for\\\\nfurther evaluation of the gastrointestinal bleed however, in\\\\nthe MICU there was a long discussion with the patient\\\\\\'s two\\\\nhealth care proxies and they felt that the patient did not\\\\nwant to have invasive procedures done including colonoscopy\\\\nand angiography, said that the patient often declined medical\\\\ncare and would not wish to have invasive procedures done now.\\\\n They were given information regarding the procedure,\\\\nbenefits and risks including the possibility of finding a\\\\nsource of bleeding that is relatively easily treatable.  They\\\\nsaid they would like her to have more done but do not want to\\\\ngo against the relatives wishes, they hope that with time she\\\\nwill be able to wake up more and more and to make the final\\\\ndecision for herself.  They understand she could have a life\\\\nthreatening bleed in the meantime and she could expire.\\\\nGiven the patient\\\\\\'s multiple comorbidities and the quality of\\\\nlife and her wishes the decision was to withdrawal invasive\\\\nprocedures appears reasonable.  If she did re-bleed she would\\\\nbe transfused with packed red blood cells only and provide\\\\nsupportive care.  This was discussed with the MICU team and\\\\nthe decision was to transfer the patient to the Medicine\\\\nservice on the floor and the patient was transferred on\\\\n[**3364-6-10**].\\\\n\\\\nAfter the family meeting and made DNR/DNI no colonoscopy was\\\\nto be done to diagnose the source of gastrointestinal bleed.\\\\nOn the Medicine Team her crit remained stable and she\\\\ncontinued to refuse colonoscopy and a type cell scan with\\\\nangio.  Serial crits were followed.  Her hematocrit was\\\\nstabilizing at 26.9.\\\\n\\\\n2.  Coagulations, heme.  There was an initial increase of her\\\\nINR of unclear reasons throughout to be done due to it being\\\\ndrawn from the Heparin site and the patient was status post\\\\nVitamin K reversal and now had stable INR at 1.3.  On the\\\\nfloor she was continued to follow and no obvious pathology\\\\nwas found.\\\\n\\\\n3.  End-stage renal disease.  The patient continued to have\\\\nhemodialysis during hospital stay.  She was continued on\\\\nNephrocaps with the Renal Team following and repletion of K\\\\nand subsequent following of her creatinine which was 8.0 at\\\\ndischarge.\\\\n\\\\n4.  Elevation of Troponin T.  Likely thought to be due to\\\\ndecreased renal clearance as per the Renal Team.  The patient\\\\ndid not have any acute electrocardiogram changes and no chest\\\\npain and there is consideration of repeating the Troponin T\\\\nafter hemodialysis to follow.  Otherwise there was no\\\\nsignificant medical changes that needed to occur.\\\\n\\\\n5.  Endo.  The patient with hypothyroid and diabetes\\\\nmellitus.  Levothyroxine was continued in the house as is\\\\nregular insulin sliding scale.  Fingersticks were monitored\\\\nclosely.\\\\n\\\\n6.  Plastic surgery and hand.  The patient\\\\\\'s arm was kept\\\\nelevated, dressing changes were done q day.  Ancef 1 gram\\\\nintravenous q 48 hours was continued.\\\\n\\\\n7.  Pain.  The patient was maintained on Hydrocodone and\\\\nAcetaminophen 1 tab p.o. q 6 hours while in house.\\\\n\\\\n8.  FEN.  The patient was unable to take p.o\\\\\\'s and\\\\nintravenous meds were continued.\\\\n\\\\n9.  Hypertension.  Elevation of her blood pressure given the\\\\nstable hematocrit, after transfer to the floor the patient\\\\nwas restarted on her anti-hypertensive meds and titrated as\\\\nneeded Amlodipine and Captopril.\\\\n\\\\n10.  Prophylaxis.  The patient was given a proton pump\\\\ninhibitor for gastrointestinal, pneumo boots were in place.\\\\n\\\\n11.  Access.  The patient has a left IJ in position placed on\\\\n[**3364-6-7**].\\\\n\\\\n12.  Code:  DNR/DNI.\\\\n\\\\n13.  Disposition:  On the day of discharge [**3364-6-11**] the\\\\npatient refused transfusion of packed red blood cells after a\\\\ncrit of 26.0 from 29.1 was noted.  The patient also refused\\\\nall meds and requested desire to go home alone with health\\\\ncare proxies.  The attending was contacted, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1576**]\\\\nand plan was for patient to be discharged on current\\\\ninpatient meds with hemodialysis three times a week at her\\\\ncurrent location with follow-up with Plastic Surgery and\\\\ncontinued antibiotics changed from Ancef to Keflex p.o. with\\\\nfollow-up with the PCP.\\\\n\\\\n14.  Pulmonary nodule seen on a recent chest x-ray and will\\\\nbe required to follow-up with CT scan as an outpatient.\\\\n\\\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.  Patient requested to go home.\\\\n\\\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  Poor.  Patient refusing blood transfusion\\\\nand all in house medications.
